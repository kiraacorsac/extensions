> [!TIP]
> You can support development of our addons by purchasing some of our products on [BlenderMarket](https://blendermarket.com/creators/polygoniq?ref=673) or [Gumroad](https://polygoniq.gumroad.com/).

> [!NOTE]
>  Licenses of all individual addons are inside their repositories. If you found **any problem** with our addons please submit an issue within the relevant repository.

## Repository Setup
By setting up a Remote Repository you can install and update our free extensions directly within Blender.

> [!NOTE]
> At least Blender version **4.2 is required**. Previous versions don't support installing extensions and adding remote repositories. Get yours from [blender.org](https://www.blender.org/download/).

> [!CAUTION] 
> Remove all previous installation of our addons before continuing. When legacy and extensions are present we cannot guarantee functionality.

&#8291;**1.** Open `Preferences` and navigate to the `Get Extensions` section and click `Repositories` in the top right corner.

&#8291;**4.** This will create `polygoniq.extensions.com` extension repository and you should see a list of available `polygoniq` extensions in the extension list. If you have the official blender extensions repository enabled, our extensions will appear after it (at bottom of the list). You can always toggle what's visible in the `Repositories` popover.
